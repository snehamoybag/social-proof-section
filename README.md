# social-proof-section
This is my solution to the Social Proof Section coding challenge from frontendmentor.io.
This project challenged my CSS Flex and Grid capabilities pretty well. While completing this challenge I had to learn more about CSS layout fundamentals such as Flex-box and CSS Grid.
I started the project with the mobile first workflow strategy and and build my way up to wider screens with the help of media queries.
I tried my best to match the given design as close as I could.
